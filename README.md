# Arbitrary-image-stylization-v1
# Overview

This project implements Arbitrary Image Stylization v1, a deep learning model for transferring artistic styles to images using TensorFlow Hub. The model applies a given style to a content image, generating a stylized output image.

# Features

Converts any image into an artistic style using a pre-trained model.

Utilizes TensorFlow Hub's arbitrary-image-stylization-v1 model.

Simple execution in Google Colab with minimal dependencies.

# Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub matplotlib numpy

# How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arbitrary-image-stylization.git
cd arbitrary-image-stylization

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab file.

Upload your content and style images.

Execute the script to generate stylized images.

# Model Details

The model is pre-trained and available on TensorFlow Hub.

It uses a deep neural network to apply style transfer efficiently.

The original work for artistic style transfer with neural networks proposed a slow optimization algorithm that worked on any arbitrary painting. Subsequent research developed a method for fast artistic style transfer that operated in real time but was limited to one or a limited set of styles. This project, however, leverages the Arbitrary Image Stylization v1 model, which enables fast and flexible style transfer on any image with a wide range of styles.
